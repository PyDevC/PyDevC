# PythonDevelopmentContributor (PyDevC)

I am Anushk Sharma aka PyDevC

Hire me :)

My name doesn't mean that I have contributed to Python but it means that I one day want to be a core developer of python.

I use neovim btw.

I am a Developer ( which one figuring out ), likes compilers, interpreters, AMD, AI, Machine learning, shell.
I am thinking of starting a career as AI compiler engineer or may be GPU architect, machine learning will be a little off on its own.

This time around I want to develop skills around GPU programming, game development. I want to support my Whole domain around a specifc niche, which is GPU.

## Contributions

Contributing to pytorch

### Future plans for pytorch
- Working in autograd module of pytorch
- Working in nn modules part of pytorch
- Working in cuda and ROCm part of pytorch

### Other repositories to expect contributions in future
- Godot (Game Engine)
- ROCm (compiler stack)
- Linuk Kernel (Yeah kernel development) :)

## Repositories

You can check my dotfiles here: 
- [dotfiles](https://github.com/PyDevC/.dot.git)
- [kero](https://github.com/PyDevC/kero.git)
- [Build Desktop](https://github.com/PyDevC/build_desktop.git)
- [model-cmp.nvim](https://github.com/PyDevC/model-cmp.nvim.git)

## Achivements
- [x] GPU accelerated Database aka Kero-Sine
- [x] Stable contributions to pytorch
- [x] build my first neovim plugin (model-cmp.nvim)

### Goals

- [ ] AI researcher (Already on it)
- [ ] GPU software developer
- [ ] Game developer ---> more like game optimizer in gpu world

### Todo List
- make AI agent from scratch
- Build a Desktop Environment ( UnixSoul )
- Develop JET (Joint ENAS Training) --> need to look into it

#### Watch Me Grow

Watch my profile grow from knowing just some basic programming to become a lead.
see my pervious version of readme.

# PythonDevelopmentContributor (PyDevC)

I am Anushk Sharma aka PyDevC

Hire me :)

My name doesn't mean that I have contributed to Python but it means that I one day want to be a core developer of python.

I use neovim btw.

I Like Compilers, GPUs, AMD, ROCm, NVIDIA, CUDA, PyTorch, Python, Neovim, my plugins, Shells, My Developer Workflow.

I have started to learn about compiler design in for AI engineer or may be GPU architect/GPU Compiler Engineer.

## Repositories

Things I am proud of that I built:

- [dotfiles](https://github.com/PyDevC/.dot.git)
- [my neovim config](https://github.com/PyDevC/nvim.git)
- [kero](https://github.com/PyDevC/kero.git)
- [model-cmp.nvim](https://github.com/PyDevC/model-cmp.nvim.git)
- [model_server](https://github.com/PyDevC/model_server.git)
- [Build Desktop](https://github.com/PyDevC/build_desktop.git)

## Achivements
- [x] GPU accelerated Database aka Kero-Sine
- [x] Started Contributing to PyTorch
- [x] build my first neovim plugin (model-cmp.nvim)

### Goals
- [ ] Contributing to torch-mlir (frontend to PyTorch models for LLVM IR)
- [ ] Established Contribution to PyTorch (torchdynamo, compiler backend)
- [ ] Learn CUDA and GPU related technology (CUTLass, etc.)
- [ ] Build a Desktop Environment ( UnixSoul )
- [ ] Learn Compilers
- [ ] Contribute to MLIR
- [ ] Contribute to LLVM

#### Watch Me Grow

Watch my profile grow from knowing just some basic programming to become a AI compiler Framework Engineer.
see my pervious version of README.

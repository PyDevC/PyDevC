# PythonDevelopmentContributor (PyDevC)

I am Anushk Sharma aka PyDevC

My name doesn't mean that I have contributed to Python but it means that I one day want to be a core developer of python (big dreams)

I use neovim btw.

I am a Developer ( which one figuring out ), likes compilers, interpreters, AMD, AI, Machine learning, shell.
I am thinking of starting a career as AI compiler engineer or may be GPU architect, machine learning will be a little off on its own.
